📚 Console-Based Library Management System (Java)

This is a simple Console-Based Library Management System developed in Java using the ArrayList data structure. It is designed for beginners who want to understand the basics of Java programming, especially how to manage data using collections like ArrayList.

The system allows users to perform basic library operations through the console, such as:

📖 Add new books to the library

📚 View all available books

❌ Remove books from the collection

🔍 Search for specific books

All the data is stored temporarily in an ArrayList, making this project lightweight and easy to understand for learning purposes.

This project is purely console-based and does not use databases or GUI components. It is perfect for students and beginners who are learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
